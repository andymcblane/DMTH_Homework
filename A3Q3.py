3. I purchased a number of items that cost $32.90 each and some other items that cost $115.70 each.
The total cost of my purchases was $5629.80. How many items of each type did I purchase?

for i in range(0,100):
    for j in range(0,100):
        if (i*32.9) + (j*115.7) == 5629.80:
            print(str(i) + " of i * $32.90 and " + str(j) + " of j * $115.70 = $5629.80")
